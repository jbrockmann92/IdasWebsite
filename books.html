                    This is a detailed engineering study of a pressure compensated system that uses a fixed displacement pump, but NO relief valves (it IS as efficient as a conventional pressure compensated pump).  You can read about the very complete test results, but more importantly, you can learn all that you need, to design and build your own low cost, but efficient constant pressure power units for both servo and conventional applications.  Goodbye, variable displacement pumps.

                    The predecessor, the 3rd Edition Handbook, has become the industry’s bible for electrohydraulic design and control. This, the 4th Edition, has been expanded by more than half, based upon readers’ requests, and contains the latest electrohydraulic technology, and with it, considerable added value. Added to the 3rd Edition’s already voluminous mountain of pertinent information and methodologies is an expansion of basic hydraulic circuit analysis designed to keep the system designer out of trouble from too much plumbing pressure loss. And there is new emphasis on mobile systems, including mobile electrical system challenges and mobile electronics. Get this virtual industrial bible and get on board the fast-moving electrohydraulic juggernaut. It is your ticket to the future. Whether you are designing electrohydraulic components, designing electrohydraulic systems, or seeking certification in the exciting new field of electronic control of hydraulic machines, this book is a must for serious practitioners of the art.

                    <h4><strong>Electrohydraulic Control of Pressure and Cylinder Force</strong></h4>
                    This is the first book to direct itself to the subject of pressure control and force control.  You can learn the reasons why electrohydraulic pressure control can sometimes be a real challenge and why it is sometimes done with ease.  One of the key issues is when to use integral control and when not to.  You will also learn how the non-linearities in the hydraulic system affect system performance, and what measures you can take to deal with them.  This is a must for anyone who wants to control pressure or force, with or without electronic programmability.

                    <p><strong>Note: </strong>This book contains the background theory and all the pertinent derivations regarding the design and analysis of controlling pressure by means of electrohydraulic servo and proportional valving. It is the first textbook that is devoted to the subject. It is a necessary library addition for any engineer who intends to design pressure control loops and their handmaidens, force control loops, and is written for the third or fourth year undergraduate engineering student. Useful as a classroom text.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Lexicon -- Electrohydraulics and Motion Control</strong></h4>
                    <p>Over 700 of the most important electronic, hydraulic and electrohydraulic terms, clearly defined and many are illustrated.  This Lexicon can be an educational tool by itself.  A great teacher once said that the key to understanding any subject is in knowing the terminology and definitions.

                        The great thing about this Lexicon is that it uses hydraulic analogies to explain the electronic terms, so you can draw upon your hydraulic knowledge to help you understand the electronic counterparts, and vice-versa.  If you have an electronic friend or colleague, give them a copy of the Lexicon, because it teaches hydraulics by using electronic analogies.  And if you are contemplating electrohydraulic certification, this Lexicon is a must.</p>
