                    <p>Linear,  steady-state  mathematical  models  are  used  to investigate the    performance    and    tuning    of    the doubly-compensated  hydrostatic  
                    transmission  (HST).    Adoubly-compensated  hydrostatic  transmission  is  one  in which  both  the  pump  and  the  motor  are  outfitted  with 
                    pressure compensation controls, both sequentially active and simultaneously    active.        The    approach    consists    of development   of   a   
                    methodology   to   converge   on   the compensator  settings  that  will  achieve  a  targeted  final performance.  The synthesized compensator settings become 
                    the input into the performance models. The  models  then  simulate  the  expected  performance characteristics,    including    speed-torque    characteristics, 
                    overall  efficiency,  insights  into  the  actions  inside  the transmission  along  with  input  and  output  power.    The 
                    techniques  discussed  in  this  paper  are  useful  for  doing pre-development feasibility investigations.  It is a theoretical 
                    study.  The linear models are based upon performance data for  the  pump  and  motor  and  do  not  rely  upon  internal 
                    mechanical dimensions, so they are practical when planning for  specific  applications,  not  for  pump  and  motor  design. 
                    The  models  apply  to  all  types  of  positive  displacement pumps and motors and with simple extensions, the models 
                    can be adapted to dynamic simulations as well, however, this paper  explores  only  the  steady-state  models  and  methods. 
                    Graphs  of  the  simulated  performance  data  and  all  key equations are given.</p>

                    <p>Most fluid power application engineers have little or no access to advanced computational methods, such as simulation and mathematical modelling.  
                        And yet, they are called upon time and again, to design and commission complex industrial machines.  Many of these machines are one-of-a-kind, 
                        therefore neither funding nor time is available to conduct extensive mathematical verification, eg, simulation, before or after committing to hardware.  
                        Unlike mass produced machines of the large OEMs, who are wise to conduct extensive mathematical modelling, the designers of limited production machinery 
                        are required to rely upon less mathematically intense methodologies and rules of thumb.  At the same time, clients expect complete success. The heart of 
                        many modern hydraulic machines is the electrohydraulic positional servomechanism, which lends itself admirably to computerized motion control technology.  
                        Fortunately, the design of such machines has been reduced to a series of formulas that yield the key quantities that designers need to increase the likelihood 
                        f application success.  It is well-known that the hydromechanical resonant frequency can have a profound effect on servo system performance, 
                        limiting closed loop bandwidth and ultimately, positional accuracy among other things.  Just knowing the dominant resonant frequency allows the designer 
                        to use simple design tools to predict the suitability of a given design to an application. There is a very well-known formula for calculating the resonant 
                        frequency of a system that is based on the load mass and fluid compressibility.  However, experienced machine designers know that mechanical deflection of 
                        the housing and fixturing works to lower the resonant frequency, adding to the difficulty in achieving system control and smoothness in a routine way. This 
                        paper outlines a semi-empirical method by which a very simple algebraic formula has been derived that allows calculation of the dominant hydromechanical 
                        resonance in the presence of both fluid compressibility and mounting fixture compliance with the commonly used single rod </p>
