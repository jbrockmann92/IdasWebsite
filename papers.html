                <h4><strong>Linear Mathematical Models are used to Conduct Pre-Development Feasibility Studies Regarding the Doubly-Compensated Hydrostatic Transmission</strong></h4>
                <h5><strong>Abstract:</strong></h5>
                <p>Linear,  steady-state  mathematical  models  are  used  to investigate the    performance    and    tuning    of    the doubly-compensated  hydrostatic  
                    transmission  (HST).    Adoubly-compensated  hydrostatic  transmission  is  one  in which  both  the  pump  and  the  motor  are  outfitted  with 
                    pressure compensation controls, both sequentially active and simultaneously    active.        The    approach    consists    of development   of   a   
                    methodology   to   converge   on   the compensator  settings  that  will  achieve  a  targeted  final performance.  The synthesized compensator settings become 
                    the input into the performance models. The  models  then  simulate  the  expected  performance characteristics,    including    speed-torque    characteristics, 
                    overall  efficiency,  insights  into  the  actions  inside  the transmission  along  with  input  and  output  power.    The 
                    techniques  discussed  in  this  paper  are  useful  for  doing pre-development feasibility investigations.  It is a theoretical 
                    study.  The linear models are based upon performance data for  the  pump  and  motor  and  do  not  rely  upon  internal 
                    mechanical dimensions, so they are practical when planning for  specific  applications,  not  for  pump  and  motor  design. 
                    The  models  apply  to  all  types  of  positive  displacement pumps and motors and with simple extensions, the models 
                    can be adapted to dynamic simulations as well, however, this paper  explores  only  the  steady-state  models  and  methods. 
                    Graphs  of  the  simulated  performance  data  and  all  key equations are given.</p>
